# V2XPlatoonScenario


This is a discrete-event simulator for the MAC protocol, where vehicle location and packet transmission states change over time. 

The application scenario is vehicle platooning. Both platoon and non-platoon vehicles coexist in the syetem.

In the simulator, we took into account the vehicle mobility, packet transmission requirements, the channel model, and the sensing-based resource selection and reservation process.

Please feel free to use it for performance evalaution, cheers!
