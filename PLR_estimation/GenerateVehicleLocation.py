Note that vehicle locations can be generated either by importing the tracefiles from SUMO 
or using the GenerateVehicleLocation.py file (exponential distribution given the vehicle density).

Input:
NumberVehicle: Number of vehicles
FirstVehicleLocation: The first vehicle's location
VehicleLength: Length for each vehicle
IntraDistance: Average inter-vehicle distance
lane: Number of lanes

Output:
Location distribution for all vehicles
